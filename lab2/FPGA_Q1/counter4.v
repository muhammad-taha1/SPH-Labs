// In order to start a new module you must first declare itâ€™s name and parameters.
// In this case we wish to create a counter4 module, which takes as input a clock CLK and outputs a bit-vector Y. 
// Similar to other coding languages like Java, we must end each statement with a semi-colon.

module counter4 ( CLK, Y );
 
	input CLK;				// We must now specify our inputs and outputs. CLK will 
	output reg [3:0] Y;	//act as our clock input. This is only one bit so we do not need to specify a vector length. 
								//Output Y on the hand is a vector of length 4, specified by [3:0]. Since it is just a counter we do not need to specify whether is signed, unsigned, etc. 
								//Therefore it is simply a regular output 
	always@(posedge CLK) 
	
	begin
// For our counter to operate we need to specify an event which will trigger the increment of Y. 
//In this case at every positive (rising) clock edge, we will begin our operation (note: there is no semi-colon. The begin-end combo acts like the brackets of method in Java).
		Y <= Y + 1; // Pretty straightforward here, at every clock pulse Y is incremented via the operation Y + 1. 

	end // Required to end the body of our method. 

endmodule // In order to indicate the completion of our module, like the end statement above, we need to add this.
